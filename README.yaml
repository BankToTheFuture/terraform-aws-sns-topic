# Short description of this project

  Terraform module to provision SNS topic

# How to use this project
introduction: |-
  This module provides:
  - SNS topic creation
  - SNS topic policy
  - SNS topic subscriptions

  It's possible to subscribe SQS as Dead Letter Queue.
  **Unfortunately** `redrive_policy` is not yet available in `terraform`. It's waiting for PR https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/pull/11770
  Without `redrive_policy` it's impossible to configure DLQ.

usage: |-
  Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of messages to subscribing endpoints or clients.
  [SNS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-how-it-works.html)

  There are many ways SNS can be used. As an example we can imagine CloudWatch sending alerts to SNS, by using subscribers such notifications
  can be sent further to PagerDuty, OpsGenie or any other oncall management tool.

# Example usage
examples: |-
  ```
  module "sns" {
    source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-sns-topic.git?ref=0.0.1"

    attributes = var.attributes
    name       = var.name
    namespace  = var.namespace
    stage      = var.stage

  subscribers = {
    opsgenie = {
      protocol = "https"
      endpoint = "https://api.example.com/v1/"
      endpoint_auto_confirms = true
    }
  }

  monitoring_enabled = true
  sqs_dlq_enabled    = false
  }
  ```
